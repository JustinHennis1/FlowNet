# ML Models for Network Analysis
## Preliminary testing of different machine learning libraries to effectively predict the correct label for malicious packet traces sent across a network. Data sets were sampled from CIC Flowmeter 2019 datasets. The size of the samples are about 10000 rows and these models show above 95% accuracy.
